# TaskFlow: Simple To-Do List App

TaskFlow is a lightweight and user-friendly to-do list application that helps you organize your tasks efficiently. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate how a dynamic and interactive task management app can be created from scratch.

## Features

- Add new tasks dynamically.
- Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox (strikes through the task).
- Delete tasks with a single click using the trash icon.
- Responsive design for seamless usage on all devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling the application with custom classes and fonts.
- **JavaScript**: Adding dynamic functionality like creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
- **Font Awesome**: For the trash icon used for deleting tasks.
- **Bootstrap**: For layout and responsive design.

## How to Use

1. **Add a Task**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button.
2. **Mark as Completed**: Click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed (it will have a strikethrough effect).
3. **Delete a Task**: Click on the trash icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
